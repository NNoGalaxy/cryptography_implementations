# Simple implementation of RSA 

## What is RSA?
RSA explained by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
RSA is essentially a cryptographic system used to securely transfer data. It uses a public key to encrypt data, and a private key to decrypt the data. It is easily one of my favorite cryptographic systems due to its complexity and wide range of possibilities it offers. What makes RSA really interesting is that although there are many different attacks and exploits on it, it still offers extreme security (aswell as insecurities).
