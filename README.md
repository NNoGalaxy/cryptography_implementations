My Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithm's.


## Why implement cryptographic methods from scratch?
I was given this idea by a teamate of mine, and found out that its a great technique to learn and understand algorithms more easily. It teaches you basically everything when it comes to a certain algorithm and makes complex parts simple and easy to understand. I recommend doing this to anyone looking to learn more about cryptography or anything cyber security related.
